Welcome to China!
If Airplane mode is disabled on your phone, you will receive SMS from your carrier with prices for their services.
Use of your home country carrier abroad may be costly, up to $\SI{1}{\textdollar\per\mega\byte}$ of the Internet traffic.
So, I would highly recommend you to disable the roaming option in the phone settings.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
%		\begin{scope}[on grid]
			\node (rich) [decision, below=of start] {Are you millionaire?};
			\node (roaming) [process, below left=of rich] {Disable roaming};
			\node (datasaver) [process, below right=of rich] {Enable data saver};
			\node (contact) [decision, below right=of roaming] {Alive? Want tell someone?};
			\node (sms) [process, below right=of contact] {Send SMS};
			\node (end) [terminator, below=of contact] {End}
%		\end{scope}

		\draw [arrow] (rich) -- node [anchor=south east] {no} (roaming);
		\draw [arrow] (rich) -- node [anchor=south west] {yes} (datasaver);
		\draw [arrow] (roaming) -- (contact);
		\draw [arrow] (datasaver) -- (contact);
		\draw [arrow] (contact) -- node [anchor=south west] {yes} (sms);
		\draw [arrow] (contact) -- node [anchor=east] {no} (end);
		\draw [arrow] (sms) -- (end);
	\end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

You will still be able to send or receive SMS even with roaming disabled.
